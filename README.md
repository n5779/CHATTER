# mini-games --> CHATTER
This mini-game of mine is a chat/texting little story-line.
The way the game plays out is up to your decisions.
You can finish the game in under a few minutes, which makes it a very minimalistic simple game.
I made it to make you laugh, and have something to explore endings in, to experience a little short-lived fun!

Feel free to modify the code to make it better.
Contact me if you have any ideas on add-on story-lines or anything to add to the game.
